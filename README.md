# Apex-Anti-Recoil

An AutoHotKey script (works on multiple resolutions) to minimize recoil with auto weapon detection for Apex Legends.

This script was designed to run using KeySharp 0.0.0.7 (not AHK). Download it here: [KeySharp Download](https://bitbucket.org/mfeemster/keysharp/downloads/)

To run this script, use the following command in your Windows terminal (make sure to run as admin):

```
[KEYSHARP_INSTALLATION_PATH]\Keysharp.exe [ANTI-RECOIL-SCRIPT-PATH]\apexmaster.ahk
```

For example:

```
"C:\Program Files\Keysharp\Keysharp.exe" "C:\Users\yourusername\Downloads\Apex-Anti-Recoil\apexmaster.ahk"
```
